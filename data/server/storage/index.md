# File Sharing Protocol
`SMB` protocol is optimized for Windows
`NFS` protocol is optimized for Linux

> NFS uses the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol to route requests between 
> clients and servers. Although participating devices must support NFS, they 
> don't need to understand the network's details. However, RPCs can be insecure, 
> so NFS should be deployed only on trusted networks behind firewalls. The 
> protocol is used primarily in Linux environments, although it is 
> supported by Windows.
