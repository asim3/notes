## Django OAuth Toolkit
The Django OAuth Toolkit package provides OAuth 2.0 support and works 
with Python 3.4+. The package is maintained by Evonove and uses the 
excellent OAuthLib. The package is well documented, and well supported 
and is currently the `Django REST framework` recommended package for 
OAuth 2.0 support.



## Simple JWT
JSON Web Token is a fairly new standard which can be used for token-based
authentication. Unlike the built-in TokenAuthentication scheme, JWT 
Authentication doesn't need to use a database to validate a token. A 
package for JWT authentication is djangorestframework-simplejwt which 
provides some features as well as a pluggable token blacklist app.
