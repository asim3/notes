## BasicAuthentication
generally only appropriate for testing.

## SessionAuthentication
appropriate for AJAX clients that are running in the same 
session context as your website.

## TokenAuthentication
appropriate for client-server setups, 
such as native desktop and mobile clients.

## RemoteUserAuthentication
allows you to delegate authentication to your web server, 
which sets the REMOTE_USER environment variable.
