## Using via CDN
To get the most out of Tailwind, you really should install it as a PostCSS plugin.
```html
<link href="https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^2/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```
> You can't customize Tailwind's default theme
> You can't use any `directives` like `@apply`, `@variants`, etc.
> You can't enable additional variants like `group-focus`
> You can't install third-party plugins
> You can't tree-shake unused styles
